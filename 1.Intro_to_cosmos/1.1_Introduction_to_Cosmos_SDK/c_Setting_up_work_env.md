## To set up your work environment for Cosmos SDK development in Go and Rust, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install Go: Cosmos SDK is written in Go, so you will need to install Go on your computer. You can download the latest version of Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
    
2.  Install Rust: Rust is a programming language that is used for some of the components in the Cosmos SDK, such as the Tendermint consensus engine. You can download Rust from the official website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    
3.  Install Git: Git is a version control system that is used to manage the source code for the Cosmos SDK. You can download Git from the official website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
    
4.  Set up your Go environment: After installing Go, you will need to set up your Go environment by adding the Go binary path to your PATH environment variable. You can follow the instructions for your operating system on the official Go website: [https://golang.org/doc/install#install](https://golang.org/doc/install#install).
    
5.  Clone the Cosmos SDK repository: Once you have Git installed, you can clone the Cosmos SDK repository from GitHub using the following command:
        
    `git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git`
    
6.  Install dependencies: After cloning the repository, you will need to install the dependencies for the SDK. You can do this by running the following command from the root directory of the SDK:
        
    `make install` 
    
7.  Set up Rust environment: After installing Rust, you will need to set up your Rust environment by installing the wasm32 target, which is used for compiling Rust code to WebAssembly. You can do this by running the following command:
        
    `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` 
    
8.  Set up your IDE: You can use any IDE or text editor that supports Go and Rust development, such as Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or Sublime Text. You may also want to install any relevant plugins or extensions for your IDE to support Go and Rust development.
    
9.  Start developing: Once your environment is set up, you can start developing with the Cosmos SDK. You can find documentation and tutorials on the official Cosmos SDK website: [https://docs.cosmos.network](https://docs.cosmos.network/).
    

That's it! With these steps, you should have a basic work environment set up for Cosmos SDK development in Go and Rust.
